                                        Owning the roof over your head will bring you great pride, but with that pride comes accountability and 
sacrifice. There’s the obvious financial responsibility, but your home will also require constant care and 
upkeep. That’s what real pride of ownership is all about.

experienced saver, and good at managing debt like student loans or credit cards. Ideally, you’ve also 
saved up some money for a nice down payment. Talk to your financial institution about the Home Buyers

                                        Markets go up, markets go down and even the smartest experts can’t accurately predict when a market 
will peak or bottom out. The good news is, if you’re buying a home as a long-term investment (and for 
long-term enjoyment), you’re protected from short-term changes in the market. Over time, real estate has 
almost always increased in value.All you must do is pick a home that meets the needs of you and your family. Then you’ll enjoy living in 
your investment as it grows in value. A home is one of the best financial decisions you can make, so 
make sure you think things through.

                                            Before you start looking for your dream home, let’s find out how big you can dream. Knowing your true

                                            It’s probably the most expensive thing you’ll ever buy, and there are lots of expenses you might not even 
know about. Everybody’s total costs are different, but it’s almost guaranteed you won’t have that much 
money saved up. Hopefully you have enough for a nice down payment. Here’s the reality in detail:
Cost of buying a home =	
 Onetime costs (down payment, legal fees, inspection fees, taxes) </br>
                                            <strong>Monthly costs (mortgage, utilities, maintenance, insurance, property taxes)</strong>

out how much a bank will lend you.

                                            Well that depends on how much you can afford each month. This is determined using two lending 
principals.
The first lending principle is that your monthly housing cost should not exceed 32% of your gross monthly 
family income. This principle is known as the Gross Debt Service (GDS) ratio calculation.
The second lending principle used, the Total Debt Service (TDS) ratio calculation, is that your monthly 
housing cost and payments on all your other debts (including loans, credit card and lease payments) 
should not exceed 40% of your gross monthly income

                                            – The big city. Sure, the prices are generally higher, but you can walk to a restaurant, maybe even 
to work. You’ll also have the widest range of housing option

                                            You will be the very first person to live in your new home. In fact, your new home may be so new, that it’s 
not even built yet. You have the luxury of customizing your home to your décor tastes. But when you 
move in, be prepared for constant touch-ups by your builder; dust, mud and unpaved roads if your area is

Before you commit to anything, carefully examine the property, the blueprints and visit other homes built 
by the same building company. Check to see you like the finishes they offer and the craftsmanship and 
quality of their work. Have your REALTOR® and lawyer review everything before you sign. While your 
home is being built, stay on top of the process and remember, you have a legal right to make a full 
inspection of the house before you accept it as complete

                                            Are you getting out of a two-bedroom apartment because it’s too small? Then your new home should 
have at least three bedrooms, and probably a second bathroom. REALTORS® call these must-have 
features “needs”. Features you’d like to have are called “wants”.
Your strategy should be to find a home within your price range that fulfills all or most of your “needs”, and 
as many of your “wants” as possible. Use the

                                        <p>
                                            The relationship between a real estate brokerage and a client is called “Agency” and there are three 
major kinds:
                                        </p>
                                        <strong> Seller (Vendor) Agency</strong>
                                        <p>
                                            The real estate brokerage and all its REALTORS® represent the seller exclusively and it’s their job to get 
the best offer on the home. They are legally obliged to tell the seller anything known about a buyer. For 
instance, if a seller’s REALTOR® knows a buyer will pay more for a property, they must tell the seller.
                                        </p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <strong> Buyer (Purchaser) Agency</strong>
                                        <p>
                                            The real estate brokerage and all its REALTORS® represent the buyer exclusively. They seek out homes 
that meet the buyer’s needs and help assess the merits and defects of potential homes. They keep the 
buyer’s information confidential and never disclose information like the maximum amount their buyer is 
willing to pay. You may be asked by your REALTOR® to sign a buyer agency agreement. In fact, in some 
provinces,
REALTORS® are required to ask you for your own protection. This agreement ensures that the 
REALTOR® and the brokerage can look after your best interests.
                                        </p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <strong>  Agency</strong>
                                        <p>
                                            Sometimes, a brokerage may have an agency relationship with the buyer and the seller. Both the seller 
and the buyer must give their informed consent, and the REALTOR® must always provide full and timely 
disclosure of all pertinent information to both parties.
                                        </p>

the names and numbers of REALTORS® on the ‘For Sale’ signs. Open Houses are a great way to meet face-to-face. Maybe friends or family members have worked with a REALTOR® they love. Interview two 
or three and pick the one you like best.

because the seller has something everybody wants. When there are lots of homes for sale and not many 
people buying them, this is called a “buyer’s market” because buyers have more power of choice.

you sell your existing home for a ‘low’ price, you’re probably also buying at a low price. If you are 

upgrading to a larger home, this actually works to your advantage. Imagine when your bigger home is on 
the upswing.

can make their offer “conditional” on the sale of their existing home, to make sure they’re not left paying 
for the upkeep of two homes. When selling, you can try to extend the “closing period” to give yourself 
more time to find your next home. REALTORS® are very skilled at this sort of negotiation and can make 
your transition a lot easier.

hard enough! Your REALTOR® is expertly trained and highly motivated to get you the most for your

                                            Buying a home involves piles of legal documents. You need someone to translate the ‘legalities’ and 
ensure your best interests are protected.

                                            There are lots of good lawyers out there. Ask your friends or people at work. REALTORS® will happily 
give you the names of several good lawyers. They can’t legally recommend just one, but they’ll only refer 
lawyers experienced in real estate. Be sure you ask how they structure their fees and get an estimate of 
the other legal costs you can expect.

                                            It’s not common for an offer to be completely rejected. Your

almost always the price. The seller will cross out the price on your offer and write a higher number. Now 
it’s your turn to sign back and see if you can bring that number down. It can feel a bit like a ping-pong 
match. Emotions can run high, so both sides will be reminded that a little flexibility goes a long way. Good 
luck!

                                            Mortgage brokers are another great resource. They find low rates for a living, and they usually don’t get 
paid unless you sign a mortgage through them, so they’re highly motivated to get you the best deal.
Your best mortgage might be the seller’s mortgage.
You can sometimes take over or ‘assume’ the seller’s mortgage. This is a great idea if the seller is locked 
into a lower interest rate than you can get right now. Your REALTOR® can help you.

                                            Mortgage term	
– Typically from six months to five years, the ‘term’ refers to how long the bank has 
agreed to lend you the money. At the end of the term, you usually renegotiate a new term.
Amortization	
– The length of time it will take you to pay off the whole mortgage. Often as long as 40 
years, if you don’t accelerate your payments. The longer your amortization, the lower your monthly 
payments, but the more you pay in interest over time.
Interest rates	
– Interest is the cost of borrowing money, and the interest rate tells you exactly how much. 
Using the mortgage calculator, check the difference between borrowing $100,000 at 6% and at 9% at the 
same amortization. Surprising, no?
That interest rate not only affects how much you pay, it also affects how much you can borrow. So 
remember to keep searching for the best rate!

                                            If you’re a first-time homebuyer with money in an RRSP, you can withdraw up to $20,000 without paying

                                            It’s a tough question. What if you ‘lock in’ for five years and rates go into a period of decline? That could 
mean you’re stuck paying more than you had to for a long time. But if rates were to steadily climb over the
next five years, locking in for five years now would be a great move. For many, a long-term mortgage 
offers peace of mind in knowing that their mortgage payments will stay the same for several years. Your 
REALTOR® will have a lot of good advice.

                                                <strong>Fire Insurance	
- </strong>Mortgage lenders require a certificate of fire insurance to be in place from the time you 
take possession of the home. 	
The amount required is generally the amount of the mortgage or the 
replacement cost of the home. This cost can vary on the property size, amount of coverage, the insurance
company and the municipality. The cost can vary anywhere from $250-$600 annually for most properties.






                                                <strong>Provincial Sales Tax on Mortgage Insurance	
- </strong>If your mortgage is insured, you will be required to pay 
the applicable taxes on the insurance premium on closing. 	
While the insurance premium can be added to
the mortgage amount, the tax must be paid at closing.</br>
                                                <strong>Title insurance	
– </strong>Not mandatory, but it protects you from all sorts of fraud and potential errors 
surrounding the title to your land. It’s normally a few hundred dollars. Ask your lawyer for details.</br>
                                                <strong>Legal fees	
– </strong>Your lawyer is vital to the home-buying process. You’ll pay legal fees for their time and 
“disbursements” which are the costs involved in title searches, drawing up the title deed, and preparing 
your mortgage.</br>
                                                <strong>Maintenance and utility costs	
– </strong>Just a reminder, you now have more regular monthly payments in the 
form of property tax, utilities, repairs etc.</br>
                                                <strong>Land Transfer Tax	
– </strong>Most provinces charge a land transfer tax payable by the buyer, and is based on the
purchase price. First time home buyers purchasing a new home may qualify for a refund. Ask your 
REALTOR® or lawyer to calculate the payment.</br>
                                                <strong>The HST and new homes	
– </strong>If you have decided to purchase a resale home, you successfully avoided 
paying HST. Nevertheless services associated with the property, such as a home inspection, will still be 
subject to a HST. When buying a new home, however, you will come face to face with that 12% HST rate 
of a combined 5% federal and 7% provincial tax. Make sure you confirm who is expected to pay this tax, 
you or the builder. On the housing offer, the purchase price will state "Plus HST" or "HST included" as well
as the recipient of any HST rebates. For new properties at $350,000 one can expect a rebate of $23,800 
and for properties worth $525,000 or more, one can expect a rebate of $26,250.</br>
                                                <strong>Closing Adjustments	
– </strong>The previous owner may have paid property tax or utilities in advance, and they 
want to be credited for those payments. Any bills after the closing date are the responsibility of the 
purchaser. A lawyer will let you know what they are once the various searches have been complete
                                                <strong>New Home Warranty- In most provinces new homes are covered by a new home 
warranty program. The cost to the purchaser for this warranty is approximately 
$600. Should the builder default or fail to build to an agreed-upon standard, the 
fund will finish or repair the deficiencies to a maximum amount.

                                        <h2>Step 10: Find a Home Inspector</h2>

                                        <p>
                                            When walking through a home you’d love to buy, it’s hard to put aside your emotions and really ‘see’ what
kind of shape it’s in. Now that you are buying, it’s time to see everything. Home inspections rarely cost more than a few hundred dollars, and their service can save you from unpleasant surprises when you 
move in.
                                        </p>


                                        <span><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><a href="#">Your offer to buy may be conditional upon a satisfactory home inspection</a></span>




                                        <p>
                                            This is an increasingly standard condition on any resale home. If the seller doesn’t want you closely 
examining the home before you take possession, you have to wonder why.
                                        </p>



                                        </span><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><a href="#">Go with a qualified professional.</a></span>




                                        <p>
                                            Make sure your inspector is a member of a provincial association of home inspectors. It’s your guarantee 
they have the training and experience for the job. Your REALTOR® can recommend several home 
inspection companies to choose from.
                                        </p>
                                        <span><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><a href="#">What will they check during the inspection?</a></span>

                                        <p>
                                            Lots of stuff. Plumbing and electrical systems, the roof, visible insulation, walls, ceilings, floors, windows 
and the integrity of the foundation. They check for nasty stuff like lead paint, asbestos, mould, outdated 
and dangerous wiring, and they’ll look for evidence of pests like mice or termites. A good inspector should
make you feel like you’re watching a CSI detective.
                                        </p>


                                        <span><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><a href="#">Join the inspection</a></span>

                                        <p>
                                            There’s no better way to get familiar with your new home than being part of this checkup. If any problems 
are detected, you’ll see them firsthand, and you’ll also learn some maintenance tips from a genuine pro.
                                        </p>
                                        <span><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><a href="#">You’ll get it in writing.
                                        </a></span>


                                        <p>
                                            Their report will summarize the condition of your home. If there’s anything that needs work, the home 
inspector will provide an estimated cost for the repairs.
                                        </p>

                                        <span><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><a href="#">Home inspection for a new home?

                                            New does not equal perfect, and construction quality can vary greatly from builder to builder.
Repairs and corrections will probably be covered by a provincial new home warranty program like Tarion, 
so bad news doesn’t necessarily mean it will cost you.

you can move mid-week or mid-month, a moving company might cut you a deal. Keep in mind, the closing process might not have the keys in your hands until early-to-mid afternoon. Verify with your lawyer
and schedule your moving times accordingly.

you haven’t used it or worn it in the last year, you don’t need it. Have a garage sale to make some extra 
cash for your move, or give your items to Goodwill or United Way. You won’t have to pack and unpack it, 
and it will become someone else’s treasure.

making changes and improvements right away. That old carpet has to go; a bigger deck would be great 
for entertaining...slow down! Take time to get a feel for your new home, and more importantly, your new 
budget. Take a deep breath and enjoy what you have, your new home.
